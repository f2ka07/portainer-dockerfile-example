How to Create a Docker Image for Portainer using a Dockerfile

To create a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/portainer24/portainer-dockerfile-example"> Docker image from a Dockerfile for use in Portainer</a>, you will need to follow the steps outlined below.

1. Create a Dockerfile.
2. Use the Linux terminal of your computer to build the image using the Dockerfile.
3. Depending on whether you are using Linux in a local computer or in a cloud environment, you can choose to push the image to a variety of locations. These include:

    a. Pushing it to Github
    b. Pushing it to Docker Hub
    c. Accessing it from the computer

Once the path of the image is set in the docker-compose.yml file, click the "Deploy Container" button on Portainer.  Your container will now be up and running and you can access it using the provided ports.
